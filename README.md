In this repo. I put my machine learning codes.
RNN_for_Stock_Price_Pred : There is a LSTM model that predicts NASDAQ stock prices. 
			 : Also there is a Gaussian Process (Bayesian Optimizer) that optimizes the hyper-parameters for the LSTM model to achive the best performance (accuracy). 

RNN_LFSR_Detection: This DNN learns the patterns for sudo-random generators (LFSR). When it is trained over a considerable number of samples from a LFSR (~70%), it can predict what the next sequence is for a random generator that is generating a number from 30% test set.
